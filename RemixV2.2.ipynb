    "# Introduction\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. The primary objective of this program is to determine whether the mixed audio can be accurately recreated using the mixing coefficients provided in the song collection of the BandHub dataset. If this is the case, the mixed audio need not be stored and can be recreated as and when required, thereby saving us significant space on the file server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a handful of cases, the same mix has two mixing coefficients. One in the settings dictionary, and the other in the audioChannels list, which is within the settings dictionary. Most times these are just approximation errors. However, in some cases the differences are significant. Therefore, the secondary objective is to clarify which of these multiple mixing coefficients is more accurate.\n",

First, it sifts through all the documents returned from the get_published_tracks function. Then, it checks and keeps a track of any mixes that have missing published track information. If all the information is present, it then checks for mixes that have multiple volume fields.

So after reading in the bandhub_mix audio file titled 'premix.wav', we compute and compensate for this offset using both the estimated mixes and the compute_offset_and_shift function. Finally, we plot the difference spectrograms and calculate the root mean square error (rmse) between each of the estimated mixes and the bandhub mix. The estimated mix with the lower rmse is, therefore, more similar to the bandhub mix. <br>\n",
