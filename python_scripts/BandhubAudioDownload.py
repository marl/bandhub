'''
Written by Gregory Reardon - Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL)

This script downloads unprocessed and processed audio files of the bandhub dataset
and writes them out as .flac files after zeropadding the individual tracks such that all 
tracks within one collaboration are of uniform length

Running this code directly performs the downloading

Please use the associated script DownloadAudio.sh to run this script
